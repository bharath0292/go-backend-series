# Go Backend Series (Part 1): Setting Up a Simple API with Gin, Live Reloading, and .env Support

Welcome to **Part 1** of the _Go Backend Series_!  
In this part, we set up the foundation for a production-ready backend using **Go** and the **Gin** framework. This includes:

- Project structure setup
- Basic API routing with Gin
- Environment variable handling with `.env`
- Live reloading for faster development

This repository is the starting point for a complete backend series that will cover everything needed for building scalable and maintainable applications in Go.
